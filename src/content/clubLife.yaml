- Title: Mentorship
  Content: !markdown |
    Here at FOSS@Amrita, seniors guide juniors on their way in the club. It is a learning and development
    partnership between someone with vast experience and someone who wants to learn. Mentoring others is one
    of the most important parts of being in a community. This is an experience and a skill which cannot be
    gained in a classroom. In FOSS@Amrita when you get enough experience, you will be assigned mentees -
    people whom you have to train. You will be responsible for tracking their progress, ensuring that they
    are doing what is best suited for them.

    FOSS Nights is a once-in-an-even-semester cultural event hosted all by the students themselves.
    This is an event where members get to show off their non-technical skills. Right from the food which
    is cooked that day to making all the necessary arrangements are all done by the members themselves.
    This is a great opportunity for learning to work as a team. The members orchestrate the cultural
    events with performances in dancing, singing, playing musical instruments etc.

    Being part of the Amrita University (under the Mata Amritanandamayi Math(an NGO with Special
    Consultative Status to the UN) we get opportunities to lend hands in noble causes in times of dire
    adversities. During the Kerala floods (2018) which shook the entire state, Amrita University under the
    guidance of Mata Amritanandamayi set up a 24x7 Hour helpline for providing victim relief. We took part,
    along with students of the college, running shifts day in and day out. Under the ABC (Amala Bharatam Campaign)
    program by MAM, FOSS@Amrita recently also took part of a Clean Up drive conducted in the nearby area.
