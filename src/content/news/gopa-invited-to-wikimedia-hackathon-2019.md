Our active member, Gopa Vasanth, a CSE sophomore, has been  invited to participate in
the annual Wikimedia Hackathon hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation at Prague, Czech Republic.
The organisation, on seeing the passionate contributions Gopa has made, offered him
a fully funded invite to participate in the Hackathon happening from 17 to 19 May 2019.

around the world to improve the technological infrastructure of Wikipedia and other 
Wikimedia projects, particularly the MediaWiki platform on which they are based, 
and other Wikimedia code development.
