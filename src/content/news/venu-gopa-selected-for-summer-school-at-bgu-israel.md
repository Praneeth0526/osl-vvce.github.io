Another proud moment for us with two of our members, Venu Vardhan Reddy Tekula 
and Gopa Vasanth, accepted as summer school students at the Ben-Gurion University 
of the Negev, Israel (currently ranked 5th nationally and 358th internationally) 
with a scholarship covering the tuition expense of around $5200 which includes 
housing, health insurance, 6 credits, trips and social activities and professional 
field trips. They will be spending a month, starting from July in the university, 
pursuing a program in Data Mining and Business Intelligence.
