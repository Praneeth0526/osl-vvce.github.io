The club operates by the principle of mentorship and family, where the senior members of the club individually mentor the juniors.
The members contribute to Open Source projects of their own interests and also conduct workshops and technical fests to encourage others to work on open source technologies.

The club has specialised teams internally such as one focused on Android, Blockchain, IoT,etc..
We believe in the holistic development of its members, and the members besides seeking excellence in technical skills, also engage in talks, debates, sports, cultural activities, yoga sessions etc.
