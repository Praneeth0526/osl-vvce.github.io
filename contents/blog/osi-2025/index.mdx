### The Event

Open Source India (OSI) 2025 stands as the premier conference for open source in Asia. Held this year on November 5th and 6th at the NIMHANS Convention Center in Bengaluru, the event serves as a vital bridge between the developer community and the industry. Its core mission is to showcase real-world open-source developments, foster industry adoption, and highlight the power of community-driven innovation.

### The Experience

A six member team from the Open Source Lab (OSL) represented the institution at this major gathering. The visit provided a unique opportunity to engage directly with the broader ecosystem. The team connected with engineers and community leads from prominent tech organizations, including Autodesk, SAP, Snowflake, Percona, Google Cloud, and Tuxcare.

Throughout the conference, the group explored critical and emerging technical topics such as AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), DevOps automation, and open-source security. They also delved into cloud-native systems and embedded Linux. Beyond just the technology, the experience offered deep insights into contribution workflows, software licensing, and the nuances of enterprise adoption.

### Key-Takeaways

The visit proved to be both impactful and motivating. It gave the team practical exposure to the global open-source landscape and raised awareness regarding various career and contribution opportunities available in the field.

Most importantly, the experience has inspired the team to further cultivate the internal FOSS culture within OSL through new projects and events. The conference also helped expand their professional network, opening new doors for mentorship, collaboration, and active community participation.
